## About

In the workplace, data preparation is becoming increasingly important. Datasets can help us in answering questions that will improve business goals. However, sometimes the datasets are not properly structured.  The values are sometimes messy or the data is not organized in a way which can make analysis simple.

Inorder to improve my Data prep skills I started using [Preppin' Data](https://preppindata.blogspot.com/) ; a weekly data prep challenge built around Tableau Prep. Its not necessary to use Tableau Prep, one can complete the data preparation in any tool or language they want to use. I will be using Python to improve my skills.
